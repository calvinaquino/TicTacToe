# TicTacToeJobber

A basic TicTacToe App, with leaderboard and data persistence between app sessions.

- Supports dark mode
- Portrait only
- Adaptable UI (from iPhone SE 3rd gen, up to iPhone 15 Pro Max)
- Supports iPad (UI looks fine) but feels slightly big. Decided not to go after iPad due to time constraints.

## Requirements
- iOS 16

## Dependencies
- iOS 16 (Xcode 15)

## Technologies
